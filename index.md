## FAQ

### Q: Can this guy not afford a decent blogging platform?

**A:** Actually I could. But I guess I'm a kind of _thrifty_ person. I'm just probing here and start with this GutHib pages for the time being. If it makes sense at a later stage, I may go for a regular blogging environment.

### Q: Where does this ancient in your Twitter handle come from?

**A:** _ancient_ - that's how I feel when talking to developers and engineers with a much lower track record. Not that this is particular good or bad. Just how I feel. And I learn a lot if not everything from these guys and gals.

What I'm prood of: I still can apply knowledge and skills I acquired the hard way from 1985 on - with no BBS, no CompuServe and no Internet - just with manuals and a lot of trial and error. One moment - no BBS at hand? - _thrifty_ seems to be a common pattern here.
